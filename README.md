## Abstract 📝

The application is to develop a database system to help health care facilities to keep track of their
employees’ health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. The system should maintain all the
information about the employees of the facilities that are related to the pandemic. Information
includes infection(s) of every employee, date of infection and nature of infection. Also,
information about the vaccination of every employee including for every vaccination, the
vaccination date, the type of vaccination, and the dose number of the vaccination. The
information maintained by the system is used to help the facilities to keep track of their
employees’ health status to reduce the risk of contamination between the employees of the
facilities. The application also includes a graphical user interface.
